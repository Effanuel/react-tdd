# React With Redux testing using only integration tests.

![Travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/rbrtsmith/react-tdd.svg?branch=master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/rbrtsmith/react-tdd/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/rbrtsmith/react-tdd?branch=master)

To run Enzyme tests:
`yarn test:enzyme`

To run React Testing Library tests:
`yarn test:reactTestingLibrary`

Both suites give 100% coverage and avoid testing what I'd describe as implementation details.  Using this approach you can refactor with confidence.
