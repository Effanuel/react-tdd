# React With Redux testing using only integration tests.

To run Enzyme tests:
`yarn test:enzyme`

To run React Testing Library tests:
`yarn test:reactTestingLibrary`

Both suites give 100% coverage and avoid testing what I'd describe as implementation details.  Using this approach you can refactor with confidence.
